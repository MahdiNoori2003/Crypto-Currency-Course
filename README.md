## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

### Projects

1. **Message Encryption:**
   This project focuses on the implementation of secure communication using both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques, as well as digital signatures. The objective was to explore secure message transmission.

   **Encryption Methods:**
   - **Symmetric Encryption:** Ensures fast and secure communication for both parties using a shared secret key.
   - **Asymmetric Encryption:** Utilizes public and private keys for secure communication without pre-shared keys.
   - **Digital Signatures:** Applied to authenticate the message sender and ensure data integrity.

   **Features:**
   - Secure message sending and receiving.
   - Message authentication and data integrity verification using digital signatures.

2. **Blockchain Transactions on Test-Net:**
   This project explores different types of blockchain transactions using the Ethereum test-net. It demonstrates how to create, send, and validate transactions on the blockchain and experiments with running a local Ethereum node.

   **Key Concepts:**
   - **Transaction Types:** Send tokens, interact with smart contracts, and mine new blocks on the test-net.
   - **Local Ethereum Node:** Set up and run a local Ethereum node to explore how blockchain nodes communicate and validate transactions.

   **Features:**
   - Real-world blockchain transaction experience on a test network.
   - Hands-on practice with Ethereum's local node and transaction lifecycle.

## Usage

Each project in this repository can be run independently. Detailed instructions on how to execute the encryption project and interact with the blockchain test-net can be found within each project directory.
